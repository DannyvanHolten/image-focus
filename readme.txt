Crop images at lightspeed by adjusting focal points. Easier and faster than ever before!

== Description ==

Image Focus is an image crop plugin which leaves the traditional path of image cropping.

With Image Focus you can instead crop your image by focal point. You select the most important part of your images. And Image Focus will create a crop with your focal point as much in the center as possible.

This way you don't need to crop all your images size by size. It will intelligently crop all sizes by your selected focus point.

= Getting started =

Image focus is as easy as it can be. To help you get started we have a simple 3 step system which should help you going!

1. Open the media library and select an image you want to crop by focal point.
2. Click & drag the focal point to wherever you need it to be.
3. Press the cropping button, and you're all set. Your images are now cropped by focal point!
